# 🧠 NeuroVibe  
### Feel the Conversation.

NeuroVibe is an AI-powered accessibility application that converts real-time speech into intelligent haptic (vibration) patterns, enabling deaf and hard-of-hearing users to *feel* conversations instead of hearing them.

Built for a Google AI Hackathon, NeuroVibe explores how artificial intelligence and haptics can create an alternative communication layer using touch.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Traditional voice communication is inaccessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. While text-based solutions exist, they often fail in real-time, emotional, or urgent conversations.

There is a lack of solutions that:
- Work in real time  
- Preserve speech intensity and emotion  
- Do not rely solely on text  

---

## 💡 Our Solution

NeuroVibe translates live speech into a tactile language using AI-driven audio analysis and haptic feedback.

Instead of playing audio on the receiver’s device, NeuroVibe converts speech features such as loudness, emphasis, and emotion into vibration patterns that users can feel instantly.

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. **Sender speaks** using push-to-talk mode  
2. Speech is captured and streamed in real time  
3. AI analyzes speech features (intensity, pauses, emotion)  
4. Speech features are encoded into haptic signals  
5. Receiver’s device vibrates dynamically based on speech patterns  

No phone numbers. No calling charges. Just real-time voice-to-touch communication.

## 🤖 AI Integration

NeuroVibe uses AI to intelligently interpret speech instead of applying fixed vibration rules.

### AI Capabilities:
- Speech feature extraction (energy, rhythm, emphasis)
- Emotion-aware vibration mapping
- Adaptive haptic patterns for better perception

### Google AI / Cloud Tools Used:
- Google ML Kit (on-device audio processing)
- Google Speech-to-Text (optional for demo & analysis)
- Google Cloud / Firebase (backend & session management)
